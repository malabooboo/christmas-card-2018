# Online Christmas Card 2018
My family's Christmas card on the web, because we were too busy to get any printed.

Resuing Christmas card code from 2016.

* Vanila JS
* Gulp -> Parcel
* Lazy loading
* Rolled my own simple modal with previous, next, close, and key presses

Smooth scroll was the only JS I didn't take the time to do myself.
[Zenscroll](https://zengabor.github.io/zenscroll/) was a pretty nice,
lightweight solution.

Oh, and I used [Toast Grid](https://daneden.github.io/Toast/).
