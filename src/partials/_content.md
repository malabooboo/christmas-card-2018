After 2 years of "high school" in the UK school system **Caleb** is back at middle school!  He made the 8th grade basketball team, and though he had been enjoying not having to wear a British school uniform anymore, in a cruel twist, he ends up having to wear a tie on game days!

After two years at different schools in Woking, **Tyler** and Tayte are now at the same elementary school in Scotts Valley. They love pointing out the differences between their old and new schools! Tyler is loving 3rd grade--especially Math and Art. He played 6 weeks of baseball and in only his first month back at Tae Kwon Do, he's already moved up a belt!

**Tayte** is a fun, easy-going kid and had a joint-birthday party with one of his friends at school and their whole class attended.  He is now in 1st grade and enjoying his first experience in an American school! He's become good friends with the next-door neighbor and plays with him almost every day. Sadly, any traces of his British accent are rapidly disappearing...

Aside from the family trips this year, **Tim** got a chance to go on a photography trip to Iceland with and 2 friends from high school. He wrapped up his time at Google UK with the launch of the new Google Earth, and he is now back working at Google HQ, playing hockey again on his former team, and is enjoying being able to watch Sharks and Niners games during normal waking hours.

While still in the UK, **Chesney** split her time between serving as VP of Communications of American Women of Surrey, social media expert at a friend's cafe, a local supply teacher, vacation-planner, and mom!  Now that everyone is settled, she's excited to resume teaching ASL at West Valley College for the spring semester.

Here's to more adventures in 2018!
